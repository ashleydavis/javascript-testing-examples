# output-testing

An example of simple but powerful testing by checking for change in the output of a program.

This data processing pipeline was created by ChatGPT.

First run the program:

```bash
cd output-testing
npm install
npm start
```

Now do a `git status` or `git diff` to see if the output file [output.json](output.json) has changed.

Try making a change to the program to change the content of the output file, run the program again (`npm start`) and then use `git diff` to see the changes.
